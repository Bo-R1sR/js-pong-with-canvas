PLAYING THE GAME
Once you started you have to control the left paddle with the up and down arrow keys
to make sure the ball does not leave the frame.

You have five lifes to collect as many points as possible. 
The amount of remaining lifes is displayed in the bar below the game.
Every time you lose a life the bar will drop a bit.

Each paddle hit will be multiplied with the current ball speed and the value will be added 
to your player points displayed in the life bar.

Every five hits of your paddle the speed increases.

How long will you last?
